Project Reflection: 
Achieved = I'm getting to graps with correct semantic html layout header,footer, nav etc. The more I do these things the more they make sense to me in terms of structure. CSS is still a tricky one for me. However I  struggled with the flex-box; Identifying items to change in my html. 
Unachieved = I have trouble adding images in a flex-box to add within a section and align them in a row. 
My syntax is yet to be clean I found myself getting confused with my own code.
